## __Tips__

- Running PowerShell or Terminal as Administrator is recommended, though not always required.
- If subtitles are not available in English and even auto-generate English, the downloader will try to download auto translated onces.
- Ensure your internet connection is stable amd good for faster and more reliable downloads.
- Youtube_downloader(video)_V2 may some fail in downloading videos and subtitles so use Youtube_downloader(video)_V1 for video and Youtube_downloade(subtitles) for subtitles to add the subtitles  in the video. Use this when Youtube_downloader(video)_V2 fails.
- If anytime the downloader fails randomly trying do download it again and again, then also if it fails please make sure to update FFmpeg and download the latest build which i will be providing.

Thank you for downloading
